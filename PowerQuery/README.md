Power Query is a data connection technology available in Excel and Power BI that enables users to discover, connect, combine, and refine data from various sources. It provides a user-friendly interface for data transformation, allowing users to:

Import Data: Connect to a wide range of data sources, including databases, spreadsheets, online services, and more.
Transform Data: Clean and reshape the data using various tools, such as filtering, merging, appending, and pivoting.
Automate Processes: Create repeatable queries that refresh automatically with new data.
Load Data: Send transformed data to Excel sheets, Power BI models, or other destinations for analysis and reporting.
Power Query uses a formula language called M, which provides advanced users with greater control over their data transformations. Its visual interface makes it accessible for users of all skill levels.
